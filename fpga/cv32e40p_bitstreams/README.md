This directory contains pre-built bitstream files of the core-v-mcu platform that can be run on the target boards.
The bitstream for Genesys2 uses the microUSB port for JTAG debug, while the NexysA7-100T bitstream uses the Digilent
JTAG-HS2 cable connect to Pmod connector JA. Bitstreams supporting other cables such as Ashling OpellaXD are also provided.

Bitstreams that incorporate the RTL freeze version of the CV32E40P core are indicated by `v1.0.0` in the file name. Bitstreams for the previous version (August 2020) are indicated by `v0.x` in the file name.
